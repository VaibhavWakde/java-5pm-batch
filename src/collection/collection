how does hashmap internally work in javaA HashMap is an implementation of the Map interface in Java,
which stores key-value pairs in a hash table. When you put an element into a HashMap,
it uses the key's hash code to determine the index of the bucket where the element should be stored.
Here's an overview of how a HashMap works internally:

    Hashing: When a key is passed to a HashMap, its hash code is calculated using the key's hashCode() method.
     The hash code is used to find the index of the bucket where the key-value pair should be stored.


    Bucket storage: The HashMap is an array of linked lists, where each element in the array is a linked list.
     The index of the array is the hash code of the key modulo the size of the array.
     If there is already an element in the bucket, then the new element is added to the linked list at that
      bucket.


    Collision resolution: Since multiple keys can have the same hash code, collisions can occur
    when two or more keys are assigned to the same bucket.
    In such cases, a new node is added to the linked list for that bucket,
    and the key-value pair is added to the new node.


    Retrieval: When you want to retrieve a value from a HashMap, the key is hashed to
    find the index of the bucket where the value is stored. If there is more than one key in the bucket,
    then the linked list is searched for the matching key.


    Resize: When the number of elements in the HashMap grows beyond a certain threshold,
    the HashMap is resized. The resizing involves creating a new array of larger size,
    and then copying all the elements from the old array to the new array.
    The new size of the array is usually double the old size.


HashMap provides a constant time complexity for basic operations like get() and put() in the average case.
However, the performance of the HashMap can degrade if there are too many collisions.
Therefore, it is important to choose a good hashing function and an appropriate load factor
to ensure that the HashMap performs well.
